# CMake using loops
Using CMake, if you want to do things on repititive way, you could be able to use loops.

== Introduction
Using loops in CMake, you will be able to create some foreach loop as well as while loops.

== Using foreach
The `foreach` loop evaluate a group of commands for each value in a list, like so:
```cmake
foreach(<loop_var> <items>)
    <command>
endforeach()
```
In the example above, `<item>` is a list of items that are separated by a semicolon or whitespace. All commands between `foreach` and the matching `endforeach` are recorded without being invoked.

Once the `endforeach` is evaluated, the recorded list of commands is invoked once for each item in `<items>`.

At the beggining of each iteration the variable `<loop_var>` will be set to the value of the current item.

The scope of `<loop_var>` is restricted to the loop scope.

Per legacy, the `endforeach()` command admits an optional `<loop_var>` argument. IF used, it must be a verbatom repeat of the argument of the opening `foreach` command.

=== Get out of the loop
The commands `break()` and `continue()` provide means to escape from the normal control flow.

=== Example
```cmake
foreach(<loop_var> RANGE <stop>)
```
In this variant, `foreach` iterates over the numbers 0,1, ... up to (and including) the nonegative integer `<stop>`

```cmake
foreach(<loop_var> RANGE <start> <stop> [<step>])
```
In this variant, `foreach` iterates over the numbers from `<start>` up to at most `<stop>` in steps of `<step>`. If `<step>` is not specified then the step size is 1. The three arguments `<start>`,  `<stop>` and `<step>` must all be nonnegative integers, and `<stop>` must not be smaller than `<start>`, otherwise you enter the danger zone of undocumented behavior.

```cmake
foreach(<loop_var> IN [LISTS [<lists>]] [ITEMS [<items>]])
```
In thie variant, `<lists>` is a whitespace orr a semicolon separated list of list-values variables. The `foreach` command iterates over each item in each given list. The `<items>` following the `ITEMS` keyword are processed as in the first variant of the `foreach` command. Ths forms `LIST A` and `ITEMS ${A}` are equivalent.

The following example shows how the `LIST` option is processed

```cmake
set(A 0;1)
set(B 2 3)
set(C "4 5")
set(D 6;7 8)
set(E "")
foreach(X IN LISTS A B C D E)
    message(STATUS "X=${X}")
endforeach()
```

The example above will yields:
```bash
-- X=0
-- X=1
-- X=2
-- X=3
-- X=4 5
-- X=6
-- X=7
-- X=8
```

=== Another example
Foreach oop that defines a list of names
```cmake
set(names "Alice" "Bob" "Charlie" "David" "Eve")
```
Iterate through the above list of names using a foreach loop:
```cmake
foreach(name ${names})
    message("Names: ${name}")
endforeach()
```
== Using while loop
A cmake while loop evaluate a group of commands xhile a condition is set to true
```cmake
while(<condition>)
    <commands>
endwhile()
```
All commands between the while and the matching `endwhile` are recorded without being invoked. Once the `endwhile()` is evaluated, the recorded list of commands is invoked as long as the `<condition>` is true.

The `<condition>` has the same syntax and is evaluated using the same logic as described at length for the `if()` command.

The command `break()` and `continue()` provide means to escape from the normal control flow.

Per legacy, the `endwhile()` command admits an optional `<condition>` argument. If used, it must be a verbatim re-peat of the argument of the opening `·∫Åhile` command.

=== Example of while loop
While loop defined below with a list of names:
```cmake
set(names "Alice" "Bob" "Charlie" "David" "Eve")
```
Get the number of names in the list
```cmake
list(LENGTH names num_names)
```
Initialize a counter variables
```cmake
set(counter 0)
```
Create the while loop to iterate through the list of names:
```cmake
while (counter LESS num_names)
    list(GET names ${counter} name) # Fetch the name at ${counter} of the while loop
    message("Name: ${name}") # Print the name
    math(EXPR counter "${counter} + 1") # Increment the counter
endwhile()
```
